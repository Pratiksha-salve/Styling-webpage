        <p> Mexican cuisine is a celebration of vibrant colors and bold flavors. <br> It’s a cuisine that combines fresh ingredients like tomatoes, avocados, and cilantro with the earthy richness of beans and corn <br>
            Street food is an integral part of Mexican culinary culture. Imagine biting into a freshly made taco filled with savory meat, topped with a squeeze of lime and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro. Or enjoying a plate of enchiladas smothered in rich mole sauce.

        <h2>THE FLAVOUR MAP</h2>
        <p>Mexico’s diverse landscapes and cultural history have given rise to distinct regional cuisines, each with its own specialties and traditions.</p>
        <div class="basic">
            <div class="info type1">
                <h3>Northern Mexican Cuisine</h3>
                <p>Northern Mexico is known for its meat-centric dishes, particularly beef, goat, and lamb. The arid climate is ideal for cattle ranching, making grilled meats like carne asada a staple in this region. Flour tortillas, rather than the more common corn tortillas, are often used here, forming the base for burritos, a popular northern dish. The region is also famous for its rich stews like cabrito (roast goat) and machaca (dried, shredded beef)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info type2">
                <h3>Central Mexican Cuisine</h3>
                <p>The heart of Mexico, including Mexico City and the surrounding areas, is where you’ll find a melting pot of flavors from all over the country. This region is known for its complex moles, such as Mole Poblano, a rich, chocolate-infused sauce often served over chicken. Street food is a highlight here, with tacos, tamales, and tortas being everyday favorites. The use of fresh, local ingredients like corn, beans, and chili peppers is central to the cuisine, with dishes like chiles en nogada showcasing the region's culinary creativity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info type3">
                <h3>Southern Mexican Cuisine</h3>
                <p>Southern Mexico, including Oaxaca and Chiapas, is celebrated for its diverse and complex flavors, often considered the soul of traditional Mexican cuisine. The region is famous for its seven moles, each with its own unique blend of spices, chocolate, and chili peppers. Oaxaca, known as the "Land of the Seven Moles," is also home to tlayudas, large, crispy tortillas topped with beans, cheese, and meat. In this region, you’ll find an abundance of tropical fruits, as well as unique ingredients like chocolate and coffee, which are integral to the local cuisine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info type4">
                <h3>Coastal Mexican Cuisine</h3>
                <p>Both the Pacific and Gulf coasts of Mexico offer a bounty of fresh seafood, influencing the regional cuisine significantly. In the Yucatán Peninsula, a fusion of Mayan and Spanish influences can be seen in dishes like cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork) and ceviche, where seafood is marinated in citrus juices. Veracruz, on the Gulf Coast, is known for its Huachinango a la Veracruzana, a red snapper dish cooked with tomatoes, olives, and capers. On the Pacific side, Baja California is famous for its fish tacos, fresh seafood, and a burgeoning wine industry.</p>
