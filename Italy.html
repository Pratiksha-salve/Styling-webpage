        <p>Italy is a paradise for food lovers. Each region offers unique flavors and dishes, from the rich, tomato-based sauces of the south to the creamy risottos of the north. <br>
            The essence of Italian cuisine lies in its simplicity and use of fresh ingredients.
            A typical Italian meal might start with an antipasto of cured meats, cheeses, and olives, followed by a pasta dish like spaghetti carbonara. <br>
            For the main course, perhaps a tender osso buco or a hearty lasagna. And no Italian meal is complete without a sweet tiramisu or a scoop of gelato.
            Exploring Italian cuisine is like taking a journey through the country’s history and culture. Each dish tells a story, and each bite brings a taste of Italy’s vibrant culinary heritage.

        <h2>THE FLAVOUR MAP</h2>
        <p>Italy’s diverse landscapes and rich history have given rise to distinct regional cuisines, each with its own specialties and traditions.</p>
        <div class="basic">
            <div class="info type1">
                <h3>Northern Italian Cuisine</h3>
                <p>The cuisine of Northern Italy is characterized by its rich, hearty dishes and a preference for butter over olive oil. The region is famous for its risottos, like the creamy Risotto alla Milanese, and polenta, a cornmeal dish often served with meats or cheese. The fertile plains of Emilia-Romagna give rise to world-renowned products like Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, and prosciutto. Pasta shapes like tagliatelle and tortellini are common, often served with robust, meaty ragù.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info type2">
                <h3>Central Italian Cuisine</h3>
                <p>Central Italy, including regions like Tuscany and Umbria, is known for its simple yet flavorful cuisine, heavily reliant on fresh, local ingredients. Olive oil, grains, and legumes are staples, with dishes like Ribollita (a hearty bread soup) and Panzanella (a refreshing bread salad) embodying the rustic charm of the region. Central Italy is also famous for its cured meats, such as salami and prosciutto, as well as Pecorino cheese, made from sheep’s milk.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info type3">
                <h3>Southern Italian Cuisine</h3>
                <p>Southern Italy is renowned for its bold, vibrant flavors and heavy use of tomatoes, olive oil, and fresh herbs like basil and oregano. The sunny climate allows for the production of high-quality fruits and vegetables, which are central to dishes like Caponata (a sweet and sour eggplant dish) and Pasta alla Norma. The region is also the birthplace of pizza, with Naples being the home of the iconic Margherita pizza. Southern Italy’s proximity to the Mediterranean Sea means seafood plays a significant role, with dishes like Spaghetti alle Vongole (clams) being popular.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info type4">
                <h3>Island Cuisine</h3>
                <p>The islands of Sicily and Sardinia have their own unique culinary identities, shaped by a history of foreign influences and local traditions. Sicilian cuisine is a fusion of Arab, Greek, and Spanish flavors, with dishes like Arancini (stuffed rice balls) and Cannoli (sweet ricotta-filled pastries) being famous worldwide. The island’s fertile soil produces some of Italy’s best citrus fruits, almonds, and olives. Sardinia, on the other hand, is known for its rustic, pastoral cuisine, with specialties like Pane Carasau (thin, crispy bread) and Porceddu (roast suckling pig). The island’s coastal location also means that seafood, particularly bottarga (cured fish roe), is a delicacy.</p>
